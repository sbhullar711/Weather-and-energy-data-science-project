# Weather-and-energy-data-science-project
The objective of this data science project was to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and energy usage throughout the year. The project utilized two CSV files: one containing weather data and the other containing energy usage information for different appliances and rooms.

The first task involved data cleaning, ensuring that both datasets were properly formatted and eliminating any inconsistencies. This included fixing and aligning the datetime format to ensure accurate merging of the data.

Next, the data was combined based on the datetime column, allowing for the examination of weather conditions and energy usage patterns simultaneously. Exploratory data analysis techniques were applied to gain insights into the relationship between variables such as temperature, humidity, wind, rain, and energy usage.

To predict energy usage, linear regression models were trained using appropriate subsets of the data. The models were then used to generate predictions, and the results were compared with the actual energy usage values. Visualizations, such as charts and graphs, were created to display the predicted versus actual energy usage and highlight any correlations between the weather variables and energy consumption.

The project not only involved the application of data cleaning and manipulation techniques but also encompassed training and evaluating predictive models for energy usage. By analyzing the correlation between weather conditions and energy consumption, this project aimed to provide valuable insights for energy efficiency, appliance optimization, and overall energy management in different rooms and areas.
